== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<strong>Q:</strong> How do I use the plugin?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Easy: Just add the following code to either a post or page: <code>&#91;DKB url="http://dkoated.com/" text="Your headline here" desc="Your subheadline here" type="large|normal|small|extrasmall" color="black|white|grey|red|green|blue|orange|yellow|pink|brown" opennewwindow="yes|no" nofollow="yes|no"&#93;</code>. As you may see in the code, there are many colors and some options to choose from. Just remove the ones you don't want.

<strong>Q:</strong> But do I need to add that WHOLE thing?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No. The only required fields for the shortcode are URL and TEXT. Everything else is optional and if they aren't specified will default to their default setting. The minimum code to use is: <code>&#91;DKB url="http://dkoated.com/" text="Your headline here"&#93;</code>.

<strong>Q:</strong> The buttons look somewhat fishy?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> If you are using a webkit-based browser such as Safari or Chrome and you have the plugin WP-Minify installed, you have to explicitly exclude the file 'dkoated-cta-buttons.css' from minification within the WP-Minify options.

<strong>Q:</strong> I am having massive problems here. Please help!<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Head over to http://DKOATED.com/dkoated-cta-buttons-wordpress-plugin/ and leave some feedback. I'll try to help out as much as I can, alright? ;)
